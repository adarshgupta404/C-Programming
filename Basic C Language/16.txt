Pointers

pointers = a "variable-like" reference that holds a memory address to another variable, array, etc.
           some tasks are performed more easily with pointers.
           * = indirection operator (value at address)
    
/*Advantages of Using Pointers

• Less time in program execution.

• Working on the original variable.

• With the help of pointers, we can create data structures (linked-list, stack, queue).

• Returning more than one values from functions.

• Searching and sorting large data very easily.

• Dynamically memory allocation.
